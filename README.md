#Welcome to my classic Arcade clone.

This is a simple cloan of frogger that I built as part of the Udacity Front End nano degree program.

##Starting the game

[Click here](http://pcmart03.github.io/arcade-game/) to begin the game.

## Directions
Use the arrow keys to move the player to the river to score points, but watch out for the bugs. Hitting one will cost you a life.
